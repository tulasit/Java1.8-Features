"To provide the implementation of Functional interface.
Less coding."
 
  Java Lambda Expression Syntax

      a.)(argument-list) -> {body}  
      
Java lambda expression is consisted of three components.

1) Argument-list: It can be empty or non-empty as well.

2) Arrow-token: It is used to link arguments-list and body of expression.

3) Body: It contains expressions and statements for lambda expression.

Ex:
        class Student
        { 
            public void stringNTulasi
             {
               System.out.println("Tulasi is main");
              }
               
               Student s=new Student()
                     s.stringNTulasi
